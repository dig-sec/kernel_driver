# Kernel Driver Project

This project is a kernel driver that provides functionality for [insert purpose here].

## Prerequisites

Before building and installing the driver, make sure you have the following:

- [Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk)
- [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Set up the Environment

To set up the environment variables for the WDK, follow these steps:

```sh
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.19041.0\setenv.bat" x64
```

## Build the Project

To build the project, run the following command:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

## Sign the Driver

To install the driver on modern Windows systems, it must be signed. Follow these steps:

1. Obtain a code-signing certificate.
2. Use the signtool utility provided by the WDK to sign your driver:

```sh
signtool sign /v /s My /n "Your Certificate Name" /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timestamp.dll path\to\your\driver.sys
```

## Install the Driver

To install the driver, follow these steps:

1. Use `sc` to create a new service for your driver:

```sh
sc create kernel_driver type= kernel binPath= path\to\your\driver.sys
```

2. Start the driver service:

```sh
sc start kernel_driver
```
